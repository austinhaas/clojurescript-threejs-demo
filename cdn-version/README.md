# ClojureScript + three.js (from CDN)

See the [main README](../) for more info.

### 1. Change to this project directory.
```
cd cdn-version
```

### 2. Compile. Start a REPL. Launch a browser. Watch for changes.
```
./run-dev-process-easy.sh
```

The browser should open and display a spinning green box.

If you select the browser, you can move the camera using the arrow keys, mouse,
or touch controls.

You should also see a prompt at the REPL.

### 3. Enter commands at the repl.

```
(in-ns 'demo)
(add-scene!)
```

### 4. Read the files for more commentary.
